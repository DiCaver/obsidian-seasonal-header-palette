## 🌈 Features
Each seasonal palette is designed to bring a unique ambiance to your notes:

- **Autumn**: Warm and earthy tones to enhance focus and comfort.
- **Summer**: Bright and vibrant colors for an energized workspace.
- **Spring**: Fresh and pastel hues for a calm and clear environment.
- **Winter**: Cool and crisp shades to keep things minimal and focused.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Copy the desired CSS files (`obsidian-seasonal-header-palette.css`, `obsidian-autumn.css`, `obsidian-summer.css`, `obsidian-spring.css`, `obsidian-winter.css`) into your Obsidian vault’s `snippets` folder.
2. Enable the snippet(s) in Obsidian by going to **Options > Appearance > CSS snippets**.
   - **Main file**: `obsidian-seasonal-header-palette.css` includes all seasons in one file, allowing you to switch palettes by using class names in note properties.
   - **Individual seasonal files**: Each season file (`obsidian-autumn.css`, `obsidian-summer.css`, etc.) provides a standalone color scheme for that season.
3. To switch between seasonal themes for individual notes:
   - If using the main file, add `cssclasses` with the season class name (`autumn-palette`, `summer-palette`, `spring-palette`, `winter-palette`) in note properties.
   - If using individual season files, simply enable or disable the corresponding snippet as needed.

For detailed usage instructions, see the comments in each CSS file.
